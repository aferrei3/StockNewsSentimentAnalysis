# StockNewsSentimentAnalysis
This program analyzes stock sentiment from seeking alpha's multiple market news outlets.
Please Read the User Guide in order to fully understand how to use it and how it works.

In order to use this program the user has to use pip install for multiple python libraries:

pip install requests

pip install bs4

pip install textblob


Also make sure to keep tickers.txt and proj.py in the same directory as proj.py is reliant on tickers.txt and it will not work otherwise.
